[Sup](https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler/status/940020622997909504)?! I'm Adam Nadrowski.

I'm a Threat Researcher with Carbon Blackâ€™s Threat Analysis Unit (TAU), specializing in cyber threat intelligence and threat detection research. Prior to Threat Research, I've held various Support, System Administration and Operations Engineering positions at Cb and DoD organizations for the last 6 years. During my free time, I live it up by learning and practicing red team/penetration testing techniques and recently completed my Penetration Testing & Ethical Hacking graduate certificate from SANS Technology Institute.
